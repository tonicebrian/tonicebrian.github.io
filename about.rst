My name is Toni Cebrián. This blog wants to be the recipient where I’ll put all
the thoughts I think of interest, mainly about software development, data mining
and artificial intelligence. Opinions expressed here are my own. I hope you
enjoy it.  

Drop me a line if you want to know more about me to toni cebrian at gmail com.
